# Why you're Seeing this Message

Reason one is because you tried going to the found page and or were redirected to the ```/found/``` page without a valid and or provided ```o``` value. This ```o``` Value provides all of the nessasary information being url, or CDN data to the found page. Without this, the lets go button does not function. Nither does the Text Showing you the working front end. If you **did not intentionaly** go to the ```/found/``` page in the search bar by appening ```/found/``` in the search bar, than it is an internal server issue and should be treated as an [issue](https://github.com/Leviathenn/InvidiousFinder/issues/new/?title=NATO-Issue-"Charlie"&labels=Charlie&template=bug_report.md).
